# Demo app
This java based app is used for deploying the application using jenkins when the commit happens in the git page.

Integrating Git commits with Jenkins deployment involves a seamless pipeline for continuous integration and delivery. As the development progresses, Git commits trigger automated processes orchestrated by Jenkins. Here's a cohesive paragraph outlining the process:

In the realm of DevOps, the marriage between Git version control and Jenkins deployment orchestrates a harmonious symphony of continuous integration and delivery. With every Git commit, a well-defined pipeline in Jenkins springs into action. This automated workflow encompasses tasks such as code compilation, testing suites, and quality checks. Once the codebase passes these hurdles, Jenkins seamlessly ushers it into the deployment phase. This deployment process might involve pushing the application to a staging environment for further testing or directly deploying it to production, depending on the defined pipeline. The synergy between Git and Jenkins not only streamlines the development lifecycle but also ensures that changes are swiftly and reliably delivered, fostering a robust and efficient software development ecosystem.
